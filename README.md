# Jellyfin Media Analyzer

Experimental implementation to add **official** Intro/Outro (and more) support to Jellyfin. Analyzes the audio of television episodes to detect intros and cedits, for movies detect credits.

### If you are looking for a replacement of [ConfusedPolarBear Intro Skipper](https://github.com/ConfusedPolarBear/intro-skipper) please move on to [jumoog Fork](https://github.com/jumoog/intro-skipper)

## Requirements

- **Jellyfin Server with media segments API!**
  - Please read these [instructions](https://github.com/endrl/segment-editor#installation)

## Installation instructions

0. Read the Requirements
1. Add plugin repository to your server: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endrl/jellyfin-plugin-repo/master/manifest.json`
2. Install the Media Analyzer plugin from the General section
3. Restart Jellyfin
4. Go to Dashboard -> Scheduled Tasks -> Analyze Media and click the play button
5. There is no Task Timer configured, create one if you want to scan daily (by default it will scan after "MediaLibrary scan" and when new items are added. You can disable this behaviour in the settings)

- [x] Filter for tv show names and optional season/s
- [x] No server side playback influence or frontend script injection (clean!)
- [x] Move .edl file creation into another [plugin](<https://github.com/endrl/jellyfin-plugin-edl>)
- [x] Move the extended plugin page for segment edits to a dedicated tool [Media Segment Editor](https://github.com/endrl/segment-editor)
  - [ ] move additional meta support per plugin like "get chromaprints of plugin x"

## Introduction requirements

Show introductions will only be detected if they are:

- Located within the first 30% of an episode, or the first 15 minutes, whichever is smaller
- Between 15 seconds and 2 minutes long

Ending credits will only be detected if they are shorter than 4 minutes.

All of these requirements can be customized as needed.

            "Default": "Information",
            "Override": {
                "Microsoft": "Warning",
                "System": "Warning",
                "Jellyfin.Plugin.MediaAnalyzer": "Debug"
            }
        }
       // other stuff
    }
}
```
